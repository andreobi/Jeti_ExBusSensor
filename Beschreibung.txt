
The sensor has the following functions
 1. measure 3 voltage sources
 2. measure 1 voltage from a hall current sensor i.e. ACS711
 3. measure 2 RPM
 4. provides Altitude, Vario and Temperature from BME280
 5. provides Nick, Roll and Headding from BNO055
 6. provides Acceleration (X, Y, Z) from BNO055
 7. provides Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, Speed, Course and Time from GPS
 8. converts RPM, Ubatt, Ibatt, Icpapacity, Ubec, Ibec, Tmotor, Tbec, State ... from and Kontronik ESC
 9. outputs a 2kHz signal to control a buzzer
10. ouptuts 3 digital lines defined by a 32bit pattern i.e to flash LEDs
11. outputs 2 independent switch channel 
12. input low to send a message to the TX display
13. Status LED with Blink code

low  rpm: 3-20000n
high rpm: 60-512000n

channel control
- assign channel 1-24 or OFF
- if OFF is assigned in case of flash or buzzer it's also turned off in case of signal lost

level definition
- NORMAL case: MIN < Max

FLASH
This function provides 3 syncron output channels. 
The period can be defined in steps between 256ms upto 8s.
A period consits of 32 bit. The bits are shifted out. A 1 means switched ON.
Each channel has its own 32 bit pattern. 
In the menu the bits a binary added 0-7 at each pattern position.

----------
PIN 0/ 1 output pin
could be turned ON/OFF bey the input channel. 
In the config menu the output could be defined as BLINK 
Blink OFF: the ouput is stable
Blink ON : the outut gets inverted every secound

----------
PIN input: low -> Message to TX display
